# metacog
Javascript code for running an online metacognition task and integrating this with qualtrics and a web server.

1. metacog_main.html will run on your local machine although won't save any data.
2. I've also uploaded a qualtrics and qualtrics html file for integration with a qualtrics survey, inline with the guide I have written here: https://users.sussex.ac.uk/mel29/online_experiments.html - if you'd like to get this to work, you'll need to set up your own webspace and php file as directed in the guide.
3. metacog_save is a prototype for saving to one's local machine based on the tutorial at https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/, although might not work for now!
