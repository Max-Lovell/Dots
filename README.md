# Dots task
JavaScript code for running an online metacognition task. This task shows two boxes with an array of dots for 150 ms each, 5 times, and so they appear to 'flicker'. User inputs can be keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen. try it out here: https://users.sussex.ac.uk/mel29/dots/dots.html?px_cm=42.

NOTE: Might not work out of the box at the moment as all are intended to work in larger studies - updates coming soon once I'm done with my thesis, but should be easily adaptable with prior knowledge of JS. To launch the qualtrics version, paste the code inside a text/graphic question and use the custom HTML and JavaScript editors. Make sure the PHP and JavaScript files are updated with the URLs of your server space if using. When I get the time the full method for implementation I used will be found here: https://users.sussex.ac.uk/mel29/online_experiments/homepage.html. The 'old' folder has versions in JSPsych 6 and 7 and PsychoPy - they might need some finishing touches, however.
